#Angular2 + Gantt Scheduler

##Prerequisites:
1. Please check https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html for Angular prerequisites.
2. Make sure you have typescript installed, `tsc -v`. 
a. Otherwise install it with `npm install -g typescript`.
3. If you don't have them installed already, you might also want `concurrently` and `lite-server`
a. `npm install -g concurrently`
b. `npm install -g lite-server`

##When prerequisites are met:
1. Run `npm install` in this folder.
2. Check if it created a `node_modules` folder and a `typings` folder.
a. If it didn't create a `node_modules` folder, check your setup (see link above).
b. If it didn't create a `typings` folder, run `./node_modules/.bin/typings install`.
3. Run `npm start` to compile, start webserver and launch browser.
